This is My blog web app with Flask
---

1\. Setup App
---
- create the root folder
- create virtual env
- create requirements.txt
- create .flaskenv
- create settings.py
- create manage.py
- create application.py
- create the blog folder
- create the __init__.py to make it a module
- create the blog/views.py file which is our blueprint

2\. Setup DB
---
- connect to the database
- create the DB
- create the user
- grant privilege to the DB

3\. Setup Author app
---
- create author folder
- create the __init__.py to make it a module
- create the author/views.py
- in application.py, under import blueprints, add the author_app

4\. Setup model for author app
---
- Create the author/models.py. Remember models extends db.Model
- Create the MySQL DB by issuing a Migration
    * Notes: for Migration to works there needs to be a path between the models.py and the application.py. So we do that in the views.py by imporing the model
    - from the terminal, issue a `flask db init` to create the migrations folder
    - then `flask db migrate` to create the DB
